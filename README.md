# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
1.Define Software Engineering:
# Software engineering is the process of designing, coding, developing, testing and maintaining software and software product(S).

2.What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
# Software engineering is the process of designing, coding, developing, testing and maintaining software product(s). From the definition, we can see that coding is a part of the Software Development Cycle. Thus the main difference could be that, traditional programming invovles writing the code for the software while software engineering is the entire process of brainstorming the software then writing the code for it and then maintaining after implementation.

3.Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
# a. Initiation - Project feasibility studies are carried out and when the deemed feasible, the objectives and goals are defined.
  b. Planning - The parameters for the software to be developed are defined,that is, the timeframe, scope and budget according to the
                client's needs and the earlier defined goals and objectives.
  c. Designing - The client's parameters for the software to be developed are then drafted and the team
                 brainstorms on how the final software will look like as well as which model to use during the software development life cycle.
  d. Building - The software code is written by the different groups of software developers and engineers assigned to the project and
                then the different parts of the software are compiled.
  e. Testing - The final software product is then tested for bugs or irregularities.
  f. Implementation - The software is deployed withing the client's target system. 

4.Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
# The agile model allows for feedback from stakeholders as well as the flexibility of changing the code for the software during the software development cycle, the waterfall model on the other hand is rigid and stringently follows the predetermined sequential software development steps outlined at the beginning of the project and does not allow for changes throughout the process.

5.Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? 
# Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements of the project in the software design and development process.
Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

6.Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
# Modularity refers to the development of software that contains modules that are then connected together instead of software that is written in continous code. This approach is beneficial as a fault in a part of the software will not cause failiure to the entire software.

7.Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
# Unit Testing - focuses on testing parts of the overall code.
  Intergration testing - focuses on testing groups of code that contain different combinations of parts of code.
  System testing - focuses on the entire code of the system
  Acceptance testing - focuses on the similarity of the software being developed in reference to the predetermined clients needs.
Why is testing crucial in software development?
# Testing is crucial because bugs in the software are corrected before deployment. Additionally, it makes it possible to determine whether the client's objectives have been met.

8.Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development?
# A version control system is a software tool that helps software development teams or software developer to track and manage changes to source code over time.
Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
# Github - code branches, project collaborations, track changes made in code.
  Gitlab - code testing, intergrated project website.
  BitBucket - code branches and in-line commenting.


9.Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager.
# A software project manager, prepares project proposals, facilitates project initiation by outlining project scope and requirements, prepares the necessary documents and requirements, developing project plans and timelines to ensure the timely submission of project subresults and managing project finances and resources.
What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects by a software project manager?
# RESPONSIBILITIES
  1.Prepares project proposals.
  2.Facilitates project initiation by outlining project scope and requirements.
  3.Prepares the necessary documents and requirements.
  4.Developing project plans and timelines to ensure the timely submission of project subresults.
  5.Managing project finances and resources.
# CHALLENGES
  1.The budget may be limited in reference to the scope of work to be done.
  2.Communication with the stakeholders may be unfullfiling.

10.Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities.
#  Software maintenance is the modification and debugging of the software after implementation and deployment. 
# Types of maintenance activities
  1.Software debugging.
  2.Software patching.
  3.Software additional package installation.
Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
# Software security, features and functionality is kept up to date adnd thus client operations are not halted.

11.Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?
# 1.Data Privacy integrity.
  2.Bias in the algorithm and its accessibility to all.
How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
# Clearly outline acceptable boundaries in the dimesions of ethics, adhere and enforce these set rules.

Submission Guidelines:
a. Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
b. Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
c. Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
d. Submit your completed assignment by [10th June, 2024].
